# collapser

A PHP media collapser/minifier with CSS and JS extensions. Not really re-inventing the wheel this code was written years ago in my proprietary Chorizo platform. Just moving it out into it's own library. I am fully aware that many developers hate inheritance and protected members/methods. For those offended, I apologize, that's just how this was built.
